  "Scheme-style named-LET, with hacks.

For implementations which can do TRO, this compiles into LABELS 
and recursive calls, which is fully general.

For implementations which can not, *if* the name contains the word `LOOP' 
(any case), then this compiles into something dreadful using BLOCK and
RETURN-FROM, which is fast for looping but can't be used recursively.
If the name does *not* contain `LOOP' it compiles into LABELS as above.

Notes: bindings are sequential not parallel (because LABELS is), so this is
like LET* not LET.  The local function defined should be considered to have
dynamic extent."
